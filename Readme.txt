It begins I'll update this readme soon.

Ok we now have a central hub for working on this Project

Some of us have various levels of experience with this platform so please reach out often. This is a learning experience, and oppertunity to better understand.

========================================
The very basic Ideas of GitHub is a series of branching out projects into control groups so we are not all live updating the same docuement creating conflicts.

When you want to experiement with adding a feature you will-

Checkout a new branch (most likely from the main branch) 
Develop in that space seperatly.
Update your dev Branch with the most updated main Branch to resolve conflicts.
Make a Pull Request to merge your changes.

I will gladly walk anyone through this process who is curious to learn. If your working on Art or Music, or Writing of some kind. I could also be sent these via DM and add them myself.
