# Welcome Practitioners

It begins I'll update this readme soon.

Ok we now have a central hub for working on this Project

Some of us have various levels of experience with this platform so please reach out often. This is a learning experience, and oppertunity to better understand.

========================================
The very basic Ideas of GitHub is a series of branching out projects into control groups so we are not all live updating the same docuement creating conflicts.

When you want to experiement with adding a feature you will-

Checkout a new branch (most likely from the main branch) 
Develop in that space seperatly.
Update your dev Branch with the most updated main Branch to resolve conflicts.
Make a Pull Request to merge your changes.

I will gladly walk anyone through this process who is curious to learn. If your working on Art or Music, or Writing of some kind. I could also be sent these via DM and add them myself.
==========================================
Next I'm going to outline some of our basic goals, but I would like to preface- I do not have Fixed vision of this project. I wish to cordinate, and hear all your ideas, and help make them a reality. If something here conflicts with your vision please let me know as soon as possible. My goal for this project is team, and skill building. I chose Pirate Softwares Game Jam, because he said its meant for people who have never made or worked on a Game. Many of us have skill/knowledge, and this is a way to hold ourselves accountable to learning something new.

Also let it be known- I am an ametuer as well. I might be leading us off a cliff!!! If theres something you know better than me please chime in, and share your wisdom.

Hopefully we all can learn, and make more stuff we love in the future.
============================================

# First Project Goals


## Personal

Onboard Youself with Git/Godot, or any other Software you might want to use.

## Project

I feel that we should start some classic exercises

### 1. Make A Box Move (character)

### 2. Make A Room With Some Collision

We can expand on the properties of these Objects once they are in place

### 3. Create an Inventory UI

### 4. Create interaction between character, and items (mostly pickup)

I would believe once some of these fundamentals are in place we could start branching teams to work on some seperate aspects of the project. 

Perhaps an enemies, and projectiles team, or an extensive crafting UI team? Not sure yet.
